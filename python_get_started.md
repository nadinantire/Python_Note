# Getting Started with Python

## 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

## 2. Installing Python
To begin using Python, you'll need to install it on your computer:

- **Windows**: Download the Python installer from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Run the installer and check the option "Add Python to PATH".
- **macOS**: Python is pre-installed on macOS, but it is often recommended to install the latest version. You can use `Homebrew` to install Python (`brew install python`).
- **Linux**: Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can update or install Python using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install python3` for Debian-based distributions).

## 3. Running Python Code
There are multiple ways to run Python code:

- **Interactive Mode**: Open a terminal or command prompt, type `python` or `python3`, and press Enter. You will enter the Python interpreter, where you can type and run Python commands interactively.
- **Script Mode**: Write your code in a `.py` file using any text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text). Run the script by opening a terminal and typing `python filename.py`.

## 4. Basic Python Syntax
Here are some essential concepts in Python:

- **Variables**: Python variables do not require an explicit declaration. You assign a value directly:
  ```python
  name = "John"
  age = 30
